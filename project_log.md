Should we have a separate social health bar?

In that case, what happens when a character has been depleted of all of their social wounds?

What are you even rolling when you roll to heal?

How does DC work?

What is a Concept?
What is an Aspect?
What is a Maneuver?

Alternate: Characters earn Boons in accordance with how the story progresses, which represents the way their skills grow through experience.

If the character progresses and the character already has a Boon in the area where they made progress, that Boon die gets larger.

But how to get a bigger boon dice?

Do all dice get bigger at the same time, or do players earn bigger dice one at a time?

Basically, there are two dimensions of character progression: number of boons and size of boon dice.

Types of Boons:
Concept
Aspect
Practice
Equipment
Situational

Black Knight Expertise: Necromancy vs. Wizard Expertise: Necromancy? Shouldn't Wizard be higher?

Maybe Black Knight has no ability to cast anything outside of Necromancy, and that's why it's not as good as Wizard.

Or, the DM can decide that Necromancy is not within the perview of a Black Knight, which means it only receives the Boon of the Aspect and not that of the Concept.

No. Expertise just gives you a free extra boon in an area you choose within your concept. Nothing more.

When people get 2D6 at Apprentice level, they can choose Concept and they get an Aspect for free. That can be a Dabble or an Expertise. It's up to them how they spend it.

There are only two cases when Expertise matters: If it's given for free, or if it's outside of character's Concept.

# If Spellcasting is a Dabble outside of Concept...

Pure casters will be superior because they can still double-stack areas of spellcasting expertise with their Concept.

The detriment of mixed casters is that they have to pick up additional aspects.

That will put pure casters at 3D8 as a Journeyman
Mixed casters will cast at 1D8 and fight at 2D8
Pure Martials will fight at 3D8

What about Master level?
They have a choice. Can put their Boon into Black Knight or Necromancy, or pick up a new one. The Boons still scale, but not as fast as a pure fighter.
